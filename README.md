#GayMaker: Studio

Homebrew GM:S Export tool (Based off the original [GayMaker Tool for PSVita](https://bitbucket.org/SilicaAndPina/gaymaker))

Run the program. and browse to a GameMaker Studio project file (.gmx).
you can also change the images, Title. and TitleID and then your game will be 
"compiled" for PS4 and saved as a PKG to whereever you choose to save it

All projects are compiled using GameMaker 1.4.1804 - the latest version that works on 5.05  
Packages are created using LibOrbisPkg, No changes made to the original source of the Libary.  
However some snippits where taken from the PkgEditor and changed to not read from clipboard / drag n drop  

Please show me any games you make with it!

#Shaders
When you compile a project that uses Shaders for the first time. you'll be prompted to browse to 'orbis-wave-psslc.exe'
This file will then be placed into the GayMaker: Studio install folder and you wont have to do it again after that.
Shaders will compile into the GXP format. which will then work on the console itself.

For *reasons*, i will not provide a link to orbis-wave-psslc.exe


# Controller Mapping 
  
To Check DS4 Controls use the [GamePad](https://docs.yoyogames.com/source/dadiospice/002_reference/mouse,%20keyboard%20and%20other%20controls/gamepad%20input/index.html) commands    
Here is what each control maps to:  

gp_face1 = CROSS  
gp_face2 = SQUARE  
gp_face3 = CIRCLE  
gp_face4 = TRIANGLE  
  
gp_shoulderl = L1  
gp_shoulderr = R1  
gp_shoulderlb = L2  
gp_shoulderrb = R2  
  
gp_select = SELECT  
gp_start = START  
  
gp_stickl = L3  
gp_stickr = R3  
  
gp_padu = DPAD UP  
gp_padd = DPAD DOWN  
gp_padl = DPAD LEFT  
gp_padr = DPAD RIGHT  
  
gp_axislh = LEFT ANOLOUGE HORIZONTAL AXIES  
gp_axislv = LEFT ANOLOUGE VERTICAL AXIES  
  
gp_axisrh = RIGHT ANOLOUGE HORIZONTAL AXIES  
gp_axisrv = RIGHT ANOLOUGE VERTICAL AXIES
